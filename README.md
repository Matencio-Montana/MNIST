MNIST Image Classification using CNN
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), built with PyTorch, to classify handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset. The CNN is designed to automatically extract features from the images, enabling it to accurately identify digits from 0 to 9.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies
PyTorch and TorchVision: The deep learning framework and data library.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): The core architecture for image classification.

nn.Conv2d and nn.MaxPool2d: Layers for feature extraction and downsampling.

nn.BatchNorm2d and nn.Dropout: Regularization techniques to improve stability and prevent overfitting.

AdamW and CrossEntropyLoss: The optimizer and loss function.

‚û°Ô∏è Project Goal
To build an efficient and highly accurate model for classifying handwritten digits, a classic benchmark in computer vision.
